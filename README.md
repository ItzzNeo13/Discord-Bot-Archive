# Discord-Bot-Archive
Archive Repo for Bot's code, Website Code and Documentation readme file.

The bot developed in discord.py and lost it's use after people became aware of the spam nitro links issue that took place in 2022.

Feel free to study the code, use the readme files as template for documentations. Giving credits while using commercially will be highly appreciated!

With this said, This repo is getting archived and is now read only. For any issues, feel free to contact me via my website or drop a mail.
